#### Current Issues:
- No data caching strategy implemented
- API calls made on every screen load
- Missing offline data persistence
- No data synchronization logic

#### Improvements:
```typescript
// Implement Redux Persist
import { persistStore, persistReducer } from 'redux-persist';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage: AsyncStorage,
  whitelist: ['devices', 'user', 'analytics', 'automation']
};
```

#### Value Added:

- No live updates simulation
- Missing dynamic state changes

#### Implementation:
```typescript
// Create realistic data simulation
export const simulateDeviceUpdates = () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    // Simulate power usage fluctuations
    // Update device status changes
    // Generate realistic analytics data
  }, 5000);
};
```

- No integration tests
- No E2E testing

#### Improvement Plan:
1. **Unit Test Coverage (Target: 80%)**
   ```typescript
   // Components testing
   // Redux slice testing
   // Utility function testing
   // API integration testing
   ```

2. **Integration Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Screen navigation testing
   // API workflow testing
   // State management integration
   ```

3. **E2E Testing with Detox**

### **5. Performance Optimization** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact:** Medium-High | **Effort:** Medium | **Timeline:** 1 week

#### Current Issues:
- Bundle size not optimized (2.3MB)
- No code splitting implementation
- Unused dependencies present
- Image assets not optimized

#### Optimization Strategy:
1. **Bundle Analysis**
   ```bash
   npx expo export --dump-assetmap
   ```

2. **Code Splitting**
   ```typescript
   // Implement lazy loading for heavy components
   const AnalyticsScreen = lazy(() => import('./screens/AnalyticsScreen'));
   ```

3. **Asset Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Compress images
   # Remove unused fonts
   # Optimize SVG icons
   ```

#### Value Added:
- Faster app loading (40% improvement)

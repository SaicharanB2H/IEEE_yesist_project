Here's a detailed roadmap and specification for building a full-fledged React Native frontend for your IoT-based Smart Power Regulation System:

📱 Project Goal
Build a cross-platform (Android + iOS) mobile app using React Native to let users:
Monitor device energy usage in real-time


Manually toggle device states (ON/OFF)


Set automation rules


View analytics and cost projections


Receive notifications and alerts



🔧 Tech Stack
Layer
Tool
Frontend
React Native (Expo or CLI), TypeScript
State Mgmt
Redux Toolkit or Zustand
Navigation
React Navigation v6
Charts
Victory Native / react-native-svg-charts
UI Kit
NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for RN) or React Native Paper
Network
Axios + SWR (optional caching)
Auth
Firebase Auth / JWT
Push Notifications
Expo Notifications / Firebase Cloud Messaging
Real-time Updates
WebSockets (Socket.IO client) / MQTT over HTTP bridge
Testing
Jest, React Native Testing Library
Deployment
EAS Build (Expo), Play Store + App Store


🧭 Roadmap Breakdown
📦 Phase 1: Setup & Scaffolding (1 week)
Set up Expo or React Native CLI project


Set up folder structure: /screens, /components, /store, /utils, /api


Configure navigation (stack + tab)


Integrate NativeWind or UI library


Add TypeScript support



📟 Phase 2: Device Dashboard UI (2–3 weeks)
📲 Main Features:
View all connected devices in a list or card format


Show ON/OFF status, live power usage (Watts)


Toggle button to control relay remotely


Device health or WiFi status indicator


🧱 Components:
<DeviceCard /> – displays device data


<ToggleSwitch /> – controls device state


<EnergyBar /> – shows live power usage


<DeviceList /> – fetches and maps devices


Backend API Needed:
GET /devices – list devices


POST /device/:id/toggle – turn ON/OFF


GET /device/:id/metrics – power usage



📊 Phase 3: Analytics & Insights UI (2–3 weeks)
Features:
Line/bar charts: Hourly/weekly usage


Pie chart: Energy usage by device


Estimated bill projections


Eco-tips and carbon impact


Libraries:
Victory Native / Recharts / react-native-svg-charts


Components:
<UsageChart />, <CostEstimateCard />, <EcoTipsBanner />



⏱️ Phase 4: Smart Automation & Scheduling (3–4 weeks)
Features:
ML-based predictions visualised


Allow users to set smart rules (e.g., “Turn off after 10 PM”)


Create custom rules: conditions + actions


Predictive insights (e.g., “This device is usually idle now”)


Components:
<RuleBuilder />


<ScheduleCalendar />


<PredictionCard />


Backend Needed:
POST /rules


GET /rules


GET /device/:id/prediction



🔐 Phase 5: Auth & Notifications (2 weeks)
Features:
User login/signup


Passwordless auth (OTP/email)


Push notifications for unusual activity or usage spikes


Tools:
Firebase Auth / OAuth


Firebase Cloud Messaging / Expo Notifications



🔧 Phase 6: Settings & Profile (1 week)
Features:
User profile


App theme (dark/light)


Device grouping


Privacy settings



🌐 Phase 7: Real-Time & Offline Sync (2 weeks)
Features:
Real-time status via MQTT/WebSocket


Local fallback cache for device state


Graceful degradation if offline



✅ Phase 8: Testing & Deployment (2–3 weeks)
Tasks:
Unit + integration tests


Crashlytics + Error boundaries


Build with EAS for iOS/Android


Store listing assets: icon, splash, screenshots



🔄 UI/UX Design Guidance
Use simple color indicators: green = active, red = off, grey = idle


Opt for accessible fonts and dark mode


Use icons for device types (bulb, fan, plug)


Smooth animations for toggling and updates


Include empty state illustrations when no data is available



🚀 Optional Enhancements
Voice Assistant Support (Google Assistant / Siri Shortcuts)


QR-based device onboarding


Device cloning/sharing for multi-user households


Carbon credit gamification (badges, milestones)
